* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* It is named `NetWise` to reflect the fact that it is a contact management application.
* By using our application, you can better manage groups of people and how you know/have interacted with them, whether it be school, work or by hobby.
* You can also set reminders on a calendar in order to remind yourself of people's birthdays or significant events, such as an anniversary. You can also view and understand the intricate relationships between you and your friends or amongst your friends using our revolutionary â€˜graph visualisation feature.
